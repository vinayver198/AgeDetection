# AgeDetection

This project is about classification of images using convolutional neural network.
Steps Involved :
1. Load the train and test images and labels using csv files.
2. Resize all the images to  the same shape.
3. Build a CNN Network using keras.
4. Savel the model weights in .h5 format and model architecture in json format.
5. For prediction load the model weights and architecture using keras.
6. load the test image , resize it to the same shape as of model was built on. 
7. Make the predictions.
